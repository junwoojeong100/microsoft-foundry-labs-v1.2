# Lab 08. Package an agent without deploying it

**English** | [한국어](../ko/labs/08-hosted.md)

**Later execution evidence — September 26, 2026:** the optional single-agent local and remote paths below ran independently in English and Korean,
and the English Responses workflow was deployed and invoked. [Exact targets, results and cleanup](../reference/live-audit-20260926.md).
This does not change B's package-only stopping point or validate the separate IQ/Invocations matrix.

**Goal:** Build and inspect a safe local bundle of the read-only MAF agent. Deployment is a separate optional exercise.

**Open your section:** A: [skip to Lab 09 A](09-operations.md#path-a) · [B — package only](#path-b) · [Paths](../paths.md)

## Before you start

**This pass:** A skips to Lab 09. B packages the single agent and stops; local/remote execution, workflow and Invocations sections are optional.

**Need:** Repository and Python. No Hosted SDK, azd, project ARM ID or Azure write approval is needed for packaging.

**Continue when:** The package manifest is reviewed and `cloud_deployed: false` is retained. Local and remote execution are marked **not run**.

**If blocked:** If the package exists, inspect it before rebuilding. Do not delete source, run outputs or azd state.

[One-time setup and learner files](../setup.md).

<a id="path-b"></a>

## 1. Build a safe bundle without Azure

**Default B: run this one command, inspect its manifest, then go to Lab 09.**
Use the source repository root and the virtual environment from Lab 00, not the learner ZIP directory.
If `.build/hosted-en/` already exists, inspect its manifest first; the command will not overwrite it.
To rebuild, move the old package aside first, for example `mv .build/hosted-en ".build/hosted-en-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"`.

```bash
python scripts/package_hosted.py --language en
```

Output: `.build/hosted-en/`.

| Included | Excluded |
|---|---|
| Shared `foundry_workshop` code | `.env`, tokens, personal configuration |
| Synthetic policies and prompts | Dev/holdout expected answers |
| `main.py`, `.agentignore` | Run results and existing `.azure` state |
| Pinned direct dependencies | Local `.venv` and arbitrary files |
| Per-file hash manifest | Claims of cloud execution success |

`.agentignore` also excludes later `.foundry/` evaluation data/results and `eval*.yaml`
so evaluation answers do not enter a redeployment package.
Open `.build/hosted-en/package-manifest.json` and `.build/hosted-en/requirements.txt`.
Compare hashes after source changes; a saved package is not automatically updated with your source.
`cloud_deployed: false` records packaging, not a live deployment check. Keep the manifest unchanged;
record any later approved execution separately.
In `session-notes.txt`'s B section, fill `Lab 08 package path / cloud_deployed / local and remote execution:`.
Use the actual package path, `cloud_deployed: false`, and **not run** for both optional execution stages.


![September 24 English recording: Package the Hosted bundle only; no deployment](../assets/g6sol-20260924-en/screenshots/E08-001-package-2.webp)

**What to check:** `package_hosted.py` prints the absolute path of `.build/hosted-en`. This is packaging, not
Azure deployment. Check included/excluded files against the manifest.

This package uses a MAF function tool, not [Lab 07 B](07-evaluation.md#path-b)'s direct project Responses with prior retrieval.
Packaging does not verify this runtime's quality; Lab 07 scores do not transfer to it.

**B done:** retain `.build/hosted-en/package-manifest.json` with `cloud_deployed: false`;
mark local invocation and remote deployment **not run**, then continue to [Lab 09 B](09-operations.md#path-b).

<details>
<summary>Minimal SDK recipe (optional, outside this repo)</summary>

**Before a request:** you need the Hosted SDK, working Lab 02 configuration/authentication and inference cost approval.
The server is local, but its model calls still use billable Azure inference. Without these prerequisites, skip to [Lab 09 B](09-operations.md#path-b).

See [`examples/recipes/08_hosted_agent.py`](../../examples/recipes/08_hosted_agent.py) for the minimal Hosted Responses server pattern. Key lines:

```python
agent = Agent(
    client=chat_client,
    name="PolicyGuide",
    instructions="Answer only from the synthetic policies below and cite their IDs.\n" + policies,
)
ResponsesHostServer(agent).run(host="127.0.0.1")
```

`agent-framework-foundry-hosting` is a prerelease Python package; the Hosted Agent service is GA (checked 2026-09-24).
On 2026-09-24 this recipe ran locally with the refreshed SDK: readiness returned `healthy` and one Responses request completed with an answer citing `TRAVEL-2026`. An earlier ungrounded draft answered that it had no policy, which is why the recipe embeds the synthetic policies as data. Nothing was deployed.

**Write it yourself:** expose the same read-only agent locally and verify readiness before sending one synthetic question.

<summary>Optional local/remote single-agent execution — expand only with the matching entry gate</summary>

<a id="hosting-gates"></a>
<a id="entry-gates"></a>

## Optional execution gates

Choose a different stopping point only after meeting its prerequisites. Do not run deployment to discover whether you have permission.

| Stopping point | Prerequisites | Follow |
|---|---|---|
| Package + local response | Lab 04 `maf --tools` success, Python 3.13, Hosted SDK, compatible azd/extension, actual project ARM ID/location, inference cost approval | Sections 1–3 and 5 |
| Remote single agent | Above plus Hosted region/capacity, deployment/runtime-identity permission, session-cost approval | Sections 1–5 |
| Advanced workflow/matrix | Lab 05 C and a separate prepared workspace | Section 6 or the section 7 workbook, not both by default |

**Service and SDK status are separate:** the [dated compatibility snapshot](../reference/versions.md) lists Hosted Agent
as a GA service, while `agent-framework-foundry-hosting` and some azd capabilities are prerelease.
Serving and deployment are optional because of permissions, SDKs and costs.
Local Docker/ACR installation is not required for code deployment.

## 2. Connect azd to an existing project

Learners install and sign in themselves. Do not unconditionally upgrade installed tools during class.

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[hosted]"
azd version
azd ext list
printf 'Azure tenant ID from your setup card: '
read -r AZD_TENANT_ID
azd auth login --tenant-id "$AZD_TENANT_ID"
python scripts/prepare_hosted_azd.py --help
```

If the extension is absent, follow the current
[official Hosted quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent).
Keep this terminal at the **source repository root**. The helper reads its existing `.env`,
verifies the generated package and creates a separate local azd project; it does not run `azd ai agent init`
in your source copy or ask you to merge YAML by hand.
An existing local `azure.yaml`/`.azure` is preserved, not a reason to overwrite or repeatedly initialize it.

| Input | Exact source |
|---|---|
| `HOSTED_PACKAGE` | The exact directory printed by `package_hosted.py`; `.build/hosted-en` for the default single agent, or section 6's explicit workflow package |
| `HOSTED_DIRECTORY` | A **new empty absolute path**, outside this source repository and any existing azd project; no `~` shorthand |
| `PROJECT_ARM_ID` | Owner's verified project resource ID; for self-study, the project resource's Azure portal **JSON View → id**, not the parent account ID |
| `PROJECT_LOCATION` | That project's actual location **code**, such as `swedencentral`, not a display name with spaces or a recording's assumed region |
| `HOSTED_AGENT_NAME` | New owned name, such as your prefix plus `-hosted` |
| Endpoint/model/prefix/output limit | Read from this copy's `.env`; use the values already verified in Lab 00/02, not new model choices |

Enter actual values once. For a workflow, build its package in section 6 first, then use this same setup with that returned path.
Keep the directory and agent name in `session-notes.txt` for a new terminal.

```bash
printf 'Existing package directory printed by package_hosted.py: '
read -r HOSTED_PACKAGE
printf 'New empty absolute directory for this Hosted project: '
read -r HOSTED_DIRECTORY
printf 'Actual project ARM resource ID: '
read -r PROJECT_ARM_ID
printf 'Actual project location code: '
read -r PROJECT_LOCATION
printf 'New owned Hosted agent name: '
read -r HOSTED_AGENT_NAME
```

```bash
python scripts/prepare_hosted_azd.py --language en --kind runtime \
  --package "$HOSTED_PACKAGE" --directory "$HOSTED_DIRECTORY" \
  --agent-name "$HOSTED_AGENT_NAME" --initialize-env \
  --project-id "$PROJECT_ARM_ID" --location "$PROJECT_LOCATION"
```

The helper copies the **hash-verified package**, writes `azure.yaml`, creates the local azd environment
and reads its values back. It rejects an existing nonempty directory, a parent azd project,
wrong project scope, a changed package or an incompatible profile.
It creates no model, role or Azure deployment and does not change the default Azure CLI subscription.
If preparation fails, stop and preserve the directory/error; after resolving the cause, use a new empty directory rather than bypassing the guard.

**What to check:** open the returned `<HOSTED_DIRECTORY>/azure.yaml`.
It is JSON-formatted YAML with **one existing-project binding and one intended agent service**:
your service key/name, copied `src/<agent-name>`, Python 3.13/`main.py`, Responses protocol,
the same endpoint/deployment/output limit and **remote `WORKSHOP_AUTH_MODE=managed-identity`**.
There must be no model `deployments` list or another team's agent.
Do not edit the copied package after verification; rebuild from source into a fresh package/project if it changes.

**Compatibility review: September 17, 2026.** The [official manifest structure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/author-azure-yaml)
and installed CLI help were checked. Manifest generation and stubbed azd environment/readback contracts were verified **offline**,
not by a new Azure deployment or recording.
`--kind runtime` accepts only this language's **local-retrieval, v2, project-Responses** policy/workflow packages.
The older `--kind workflow` is the distinct CI Invocations preset; it is not a shortcut for this exercise.

## 3. Local server: two terminals

Keep local `.env` authentication as `cli`, distinct from azd's remote runtime configuration.

**Terminal A — reuse the setup terminal from section 2 at the source repository root:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/workshop.py --language en serve
```

This foreground server occupies terminal A on local port 8088; no new shell prompt is expected.
Leave it running and use terminal B for the next block.

**Terminal B:**

Open a second terminal at the **same source repository root**. Shell variables from A are not automatically present in B;
enter the standalone directory recorded in step 2. `--cwd` selects its azd project without moving your shell.
For a workflow package, use section 6's matching server/invocation instead of this default single-agent block.

```bash
printf 'Standalone Hosted directory from step 2: '
read -r HOSTED_DIRECTORY
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8088/readiness &&
azd ai agent invoke --cwd "${HOSTED_DIRECTORY:?Use the prepared standalone directory}" --local --port 8088 --new-session --new-conversation --timeout 120 "Explain the domestic lodging limit and evidence for September 2026."
```

The question requests the September 2026 domestic lodging limit and sources.



**What to check:** B first prints `{"status":"healthy"}` (rechecked September 15, 2026), not `status: ready`.
This `curl` command prints the body, not the HTTP status. If readiness fails, `&&` skips the invocation;
inspect terminal A and use [Hosted recovery](../reference/troubleshooting.md#common-blockers).
A successful readiness check proves server availability, not model inference.


**What to check:** Inspect the limit/evidence and fresh **Session / Conversation**.
This local invocation still calls a billable Azure model; it is not remote-deployment evidence.

After checking the answer and sources, stop only this server with `Ctrl+C` in terminal A.
For local-only work, skip section 4 and record the result in section 5.

## 4. Remote deployment: separate cost and permission approval

Review any additional resource/identity plan with the instructor.
An existing project does not make every prerequisite complete.
If provisioning is required, run it only after **review and authorization for the
dedicated training scope**.
Return to terminal A after stopping its local server. It retains step 2's `HOSTED_AGENT_NAME` and `HOSTED_DIRECTORY`;
if you opened a new terminal, restore those exact values from your notes first.
Deploy **only that agent service** in the standalone project, not every service in your source repository.

```bash
azd deploy "${HOSTED_AGENT_NAME:?Use the prepared agent service name}" --cwd "${HOSTED_DIRECTORY:?Use the prepared standalone directory}" &&
azd ai agent show --cwd "${HOSTED_DIRECTORY:?Use the prepared standalone directory}" --output json
```

Stop if deployment fails; an older active version is not proof this deployment succeeded.
Record active state, actual version, and endpoint before invocation.
The `${...:?}` guards stop before azd runs if a required value is empty; they must not be removed to bypass an error.


**What to check:** Inspect the completion message and **Agent playground / Agent
endpoint**, then verify the real version and active state from `show`.

```bash
printf 'Actual version returned by show: '
read -r HOSTED_AGENT_VERSION
azd ai agent invoke --cwd "${HOSTED_DIRECTORY:?Use the prepared standalone directory}" --version "${HOSTED_AGENT_VERSION:?Use the version returned by show}" --new-session --new-conversation --timeout 270 "What are the advance-approval requirements for a KRW 170000 hotel on a domestic business trip in September 2026?"
```

The question asks for advance approval for the over-limit September 2026 hotel.


**What to check:** Retain **Session**, **Conversation**, and **Trace ID** with the answer.
Use that Trace ID in the next lab. One successful request is not full-dev quality evaluation.

Responses **sessions and conversations are separate**. `--new-session` alone may
reuse a conversation. Use both flags for independent checks; deliberately reuse a
conversation only when testing continuity.
Local users and remote agent identities differ. Repeated local `az login` cannot fix
a remote identity's 403; its actual model/tool permissions need review.

## 5. Record the limits of the evidence

**Local-only:** save the smoke response or error in `session-notes.txt`, mark remote deployment/evaluation **not run**,
and continue to [Lab 09 B](09-operations.md#path-b). A failed smoke remains incomplete; remote work is not required to finish this branch.

This Hosted example uses the shared MAF function tool. It is **not the same path**
as Lab 07's project Responses with precomputed retrieval. Any later Hosted quality claim needs a separately approved
evaluation of that exact version; Lab 07 scores are not transferable.


Verify evaluation type, exact agent/version, evaluator, and the complete case denominator.
The September 24 `gpt-6-sol` recording covers packaging only. Section 3's local server, `azd ai agent invoke --local` and your own
remote deployment were not re-run; in the September 24 evening check, section 6's workflow server answered one Responses request
sent with `curl`. A separate approved CI release deployed the workflow profile with `gpt-6-sol` on September 23
([release operations](extensions/release-operations.md#5-define-the-release-sequence)). See [execution records](../live-run.md);
do not transfer scores between these targets.

</details>

## 6. Deploy a MAF workflow as a Hosted Agent

<details>
<summary>Advanced C: a separate workflow target; first-pass B continues to Lab 09</summary>

Default serve/package commands retain the earlier single-function-agent path.
Explicit workflow profiles freeze kind, pattern, retrieval, prompt, API, protocol, and language.
Do not reuse single-agent scores as evidence for the workflow target.

At the source repository root with `.venv` active, the **first command makes billable Azure model calls**;
the second only builds a local package. `&&` prevents packaging after a failed workflow check.

```bash
python scripts/workshop.py --language en workflow-agent --pattern sequential --retrieval local --prompt v2 &&
python scripts/package_hosted.py --language en --kind workflow --pattern sequential
```

The package is `.build/workflow-sequential-local-v2-project-responses-responses-en/`.
Concurrent/group-chat use separate profile directories.
Packages are not overwritten; reference answers, holdout, and evaluator files are excluded.
This walkthrough uses **sequential**. For another pattern, change it explicitly in both packaging and `serve`;
the local server must match the selected package, not merely respond on the same port.

Complete **section 2's shared setup** with this exact returned package, a new owned agent name and a new empty directory.
Do not initialize another service in the source copy. Then use the following matching workflow command
**instead of section 3's default single-agent server**.

Terminal A, at the source repository root with `.venv` active: if section 3's server is still running,
stop it with `Ctrl+C` here before starting the workflow server. Leave this replacement running for terminal B.

```bash
python scripts/workshop.py --language en serve --kind workflow --pattern sequential
```

Terminal B, at the source repository root:

```bash
printf 'Standalone workflow directory prepared in step 2: '
read -r HOSTED_DIRECTORY
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8088/readiness &&
azd ai agent invoke --cwd "${HOSTED_DIRECTORY:?Use the prepared standalone directory}" --local --port 8088 --new-session --new-conversation --timeout 270 "Explain the limit and advance-approval requirements for a KRW 170000 domestic business-trip hotel in September 2026."
```

Inspect workflow kind, participants, actual model calls, final answer/evidence, and pending review status.
The outer workflow UUID can differ from the actual model response ID inside JSON.
For approved remote work, run **section 4 once** using this workflow's directory/name and actual returned version.
There is no second workflow deployment command to repeat here.

```

Fresh internal participants isolate requests.
Durable approval, crash recovery, and external business actions are not enabled automatically.

## 7. Typed Invocations versus Responses

<details>
<summary>Advanced C: open only when selecting the Hosted evaluation workbook</summary>

Use Responses for conversation and a separate Invocations profile for strict model/case/run matrices.

**Do not package here and repeat the same package command in the workbook.**
Start at [the workbook's preparation](../reference/evaluation-workbook.md#matrix-setup).
Its explicit profile is `workflow / sequential / iq / v1 → v2 / account-chat / invocations`.

Only question, model key, case ID, and run ID are accepted.
No reference answers, evaluator configuration, corpus paths, or arbitrary model/endpoint overrides enter the request.
Actual deployment/service IDs, usage, and evidence hashes remain in the response.
Follow the [evaluation workbook](../reference/evaluation-workbook.md); do not transfer scores between target paths.
The workbook uses the separate `--kind matrix` preparation path.
The introductory `--kind runtime` and single-model CI `--kind workflow` contracts are unchanged.

## B completion and cleanup

A has nothing to record in Lab 08. B records packaging, and any optional local response, remote deployment and remote
evaluation, as separate outcomes.
Sessions may be reused and accumulate compute cost. Use the explicitly scoped
[Hosted cleanup steps](../reference/cleanup.md#hosted-sessions) for your own sessions.
Do not apply `azd down` indiscriminately to every environment.
