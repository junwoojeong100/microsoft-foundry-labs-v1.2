# Additional tools: verify a generated artifact and an API boundary

**English** | [한국어](../../ko/labs/extensions/additional-tools.md)

**Path B/C, optional.** Start with **Code Interpreter over the six bundled synthetic policy records**.

**Evidence status:** the English Code Interpreter and OpenAPI results date from September 16, 2026 (earlier `gpt-5.6-luna` preset); not re-run with `gpt-6-sol`.

OpenAPI is a separate integration branch. Neither requires real company data.

**Need:** working project/model access, regional/model support for the selected tool,
permission to create a dedicated agent/uploaded file and approval for model plus sandbox charges.
**Stop when:** an actual code call produced a downloaded CSV that preserves every original policy ID/title.
**If blocked:** before an attempt, record the missing prerequisite and **not run**.
After an attempted run, record **failed/blocked**, keep the original error/file IDs and use step 4 for recorded owned resources.
Do not generate the expected artifact locally and claim the tool made it.

**First pass:** Code Interpreter steps 1–4, then handoff. OpenAPI is a separate choice,
not a second tool you must run after a verified CSV.
Step 2 is **live Azure execution**: it uploads a file and creates owned resources. There is no offline Code Interpreter run in this helper.

## 1. Know what is being tested

The input CSV is derived from the canonical six policy documents.
The requested output contains exactly two columns, `id,title`, and the same six rows in order.
No policy answer, financial calculation or model ranking is being evaluated.

Code Interpreter has additional session/container charges beyond model tokens.
The example does not promise that stopping a chat eliminates those charges immediately.

## 2. Execute once

Use an unused label. If `outputs/code-interpreter/code-policy-table/` already exists, preserve it;
cleanup does not make that label reusable. Diagnose the earlier attempt before approving another billable run.
For a new attempt, change `code-policy-table` consistently in the `run` command, step 3's directory,
and the `cleanup` command. Keep each attempt's ownership record and clean up using that attempt's own label.

```bash
python scripts/workshop.py --language en code-interpreter run --label code-policy-table --confirm-create --confirm-cost
```

The helper uploads only its generated synthetic CSV, creates a uniquely named Prompt Agent,
pins the returned version in the request, and requires a real Code Interpreter tool call.
It does not load an arbitrary user-selected file or allow a different input corpus.

## 3. Inspect the exact artifacts

Open `outputs/code-interpreter/code-policy-table/`:

| File | What to verify |
|---|---|
| `policy-records.csv` | Generated locally from the six canonical documents; this is the uploaded input, not the sandbox result |
| `ownership.json` | Actual uploaded file, agent/version and container identifiers |
| `request.json` | Fixed task and exact agent version |
| `response.json` | Actual completed code call and generated-file citation |
| `policy-summary.csv` | Downloaded from the actual container file API, not created as a fallback |
| `summary.json` | Source/output hashes and `verified_rows: 6` |

The helper accepts one generated CSV citation from a container actually reported by the code call.
It writes to a fixed local filename rather than trusting a model-provided path.
Wrong columns, missing/duplicate/reordered rows or modified titles fail verification.
Keep the mismatched output unchanged for diagnosis.
A failed run may leave only some of these files; a missing `summary.json` is not a pass.

## 4. Clean up the owned temporary resources

Use the same attempt's label even when upload, inference or CSV verification failed.
Run cleanup only if that attempt has `ownership.json`; otherwise hand off the error and record **cleanup not run — no ownership record**.
Do not invent resource IDs or rerun inference to obtain a cleanup record.

```bash
python scripts/workshop.py --language en code-interpreter cleanup --label code-policy-table --confirm-delete
```

The command acts only on the recorded dedicated agent version, uploaded file and generated container.
It retains local evidence and refuses a name/project mismatch or additional agent versions.
Read back resource states and check residual billing; cleanup requests are not proof of zero cost.

## 5. OpenAPI branch: use the already-owned synthetic Search API

<details>
<summary>Optional independent OpenAPI exercise — requires Lab 06's owned index and runtime identity</summary>

An OpenAPI tool exposes an HTTP API contract. It is not the same as a Python function,
an A2A endpoint or Code Interpreter's sandbox.

This branch uses the existing Search REST API and your **owned six-document index** from Lab 06.
No new API Management, custom API server or company connection is needed.
The generated OpenAPI 3.1 specification exposes only the index's read-only search operation.
HTTP POST here means a query; it does not upload, update or delete documents.

Before invoking, the owner verifies:

- The same `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME` as the synthetic seed ledger.
- Authentication and token audience; no keys or secrets copied into prompts.
- Caller identity and target permissions.
- Exact request/response shape, a safe test input, cost/rate bounds and cleanup owner.

The **Foundry account's system-assigned managed identity** needs **Search Index Data Reader** on that Search service.
This direct OpenAPI path does not use the native Toolbox's project managed identity or the local learner's identity.
On September 27, 2026, granting the project identity's Toolbox role fixed Toolbox but not OpenAPI; the account identity's
read-only data role fixed the actual OpenAPI call. The local plan reports `managed_identity_owner: foundry-account` and the required role.
Its token audience is **`https://search.azure.com`**, not the Foundry project endpoint.
This is separate from your local user's Search access.

```bash
python scripts/workshop.py --language en openapi plan
```

The plan is local (`azure_requests_sent: false`); it does not verify the remote index or runtime permissions.
Verify the one-server, one-index, read-only definition and have the owner confirm those permissions before the billable request:

```bash
python scripts/workshop.py --language en openapi invoke --label openapi-policy --confirm-cost
```

The plan must contain one server, one owned index path and one `SearchSyntheticPolicies` operation.
The required query argument is **`api-version=2024-07-01`**, alongside `top=6` and the fixed selected fields.
An OpenAPI schema default does not guarantee that a model sends the argument. A September 27 Korean attempt omitted it
and failed before Search execution; the helper now states the required literal key/value explicitly, and both languages were rechecked.
Keep a `Missing required query parameter` error distinct from an identity-related `403`; do not fix one by changing the other's settings.
Inspect `outputs/openapi-runs/openapi-policy/plan.json`, `request.json`, `response.json` and `summary.json`.
The response must contain an actual completed `openapi_call`; a plausible answer or a native Search call is not enough.
Keep the specification hash, actual source data and response/model metadata.

Do not add a key or silently replace this tool with `retrieve --provider search` after an authentication or schema error.
**Read the nested service error before changing the schema.** On September 26, 2026 an OpenAPI request returned outer HTTP `400`
with `tool_user_error`, while `service-error.json` recorded the actual downstream Search HTTP `403`.
That is an access failure for the tool's runtime identity, not proof of an invalid OpenAPI schema. Preserve the request ID and original error;
have the owner verify that identity's scoped Search access before another paid attempt. Do not repeat local sign-in or add an API key.
If the Search index or managed-identity permission is not prepared, stop and record **not run**.
The direct Responses request creates no persistent Prompt Agent definition; source/index/model costs and any newly added role still require owner review.
