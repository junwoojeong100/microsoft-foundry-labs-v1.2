# Lab 00. Getting started and shared setup

**English** | [한국어](../ko/labs/00-start.md)

**Goal:** Identify your account, project, and learning path, and verify the starting point for the next lab.

**Open your section:** [A — browser](#path-a) · [B — code](#path-b) · [Offline only](#offline-rehearsal) · [Paths](../paths.md)

## Before you start

**This pass:** Read the setup card. A uses the browser and learner ZIP; B uses the source repository and its included notes.

**Need:** Your own account, prepared project and model; B additionally needs Python 3.13 and a terminal.

**Continue when:** A: the right project is open and the values are recorded. B: offline checks and cloud preflight are understood.

**If blocked:** Stop and ask the owner to confirm the tenant, the project name, your **Foundry User** role on the project and access to `gpt-6-sol`. Do not pick another resource.

[One-time setup and learner files](../setup.md).

## How to read this guide

<details>
<summary>Optional screenshot help — execute the current text, not the recording</summary>

Reference images come from the **September 24, 2026 English recording with `gpt-6-sol`** and dated September 25 checks/supplements.
Each caption identifies its source; these used a separate training project and synthetic learner files.
[Recordings and scope](../video-summary.md) distinguish actual calls, fixtures, observations, and what was not recorded.
Click to enlarge. Compare account, project, model, and prefix with your instructor's
values; do not copy identifiers from images.

In terminal images, read the **last entered command** (the line with text after `workshop $`)
and its output. Earlier output can remain above it. An empty prompt at the bottom means
the command finished. Distinguish `OFFLINE FIXTURE` from `LIVE AZURE`.
`RUN_TOOLS/configure_env.py` in the `.env` step is a recording helper that wrote the setup-card values; edit `.env` yourself.
**Execute the code blocks in the guide**, not text transcribed from screenshots.
More before/after views are in the [action index](../action-captures.md).

Use `--language en` for the separately frozen English policies, prompts, dev/holdout/calibration data, and fixtures.
Korean originals remain unchanged. [Language-specific hashes and labels](../reference/languages.md)
prevent translated datasets from being presented as the same-input experiment.

## A. Browser: no coding required

**Learning alone?** If [self-study preparation](../setup-owner.md#self-study) is not complete, finish it first.
If you are returning from that preparation or Lab 02 B's A-terminal check, keep the same project, files and terminal and start at step 1 below; do not prepare them again.

1. Open `https://ai.azure.com` in Edge or Chrome.
2. Sign in with the **Microsoft Entra account and directory (tenant)** verified on your setup card.
   Personal Microsoft, GitHub, and Azure work-account sign-ins are different.
   A successful sign-in to your usual work account does not establish access to the training tenant.
   If the portal URL shows `tid=`, compare it with the setup card's tenant ID before changing permissions;
   use [the tenant check](../reference/troubleshooting.md#portal-tenant) when they differ.
3. Select the training project, not a similarly named production project.
   If the project picker is hard to use, choose **View all resources**, search for the project name,
   and check its name, parent resource and region before opening it.
4. If not already done during setup, download and extract [the learner ZIP](../../data/learner/en/learner-materials.zip) and keep `START-HERE.txt` open.
   [Lab 05](05-workflows.md) later runs one prepared option, by default a command in a prepared terminal;
   you will not write Python or build a portal workflow.
5. Open the ZIP's `session-notes.txt`. In its **Lab 00 - setup card** section, check each line you filled during setup and complete any blank one.
   Do not post whole screens or personal information in shared chat.

| Line in `session-notes.txt` | What to write |
|---|---|
| `Language / path:` | `English / A` |
| `Tenant / subscription:` | The owner's values; they match the directory you signed in to |
| `Resource group / Foundry account / project:` | The owner's values; the project matches the one you opened |
| `Full project endpoint:` | The owner's value; Lab 01 checks it on **Home** |
| `Search endpoint (B only):` | `not used` for A; B records the owner's verified Search URL for Lab 06 |
| `Answer deployment / model version:` | `gpt-6-sol` / `2026-09-22` |
| `Personal prefix:` | Your owner-confirmed unique prefix from setup; do not copy the example or another learner's value |
| `Cost and permission owner:` | The person who approves costs and roles; yourself when learning alone |
| `Prepared MAF terminal location:` | Where to open the terminal prepared for Lab 05 (learning alone: your source folder), or `not used` for the Playground option |
| `Optional IQ Chat selected or not selected:` | `not selected`, unless the owner prepared it for you |

![September 24 English recording: Open the intended training project](../assets/g6sol-20260924-en/screenshots/EP00-001-home-2.webp)

**What to check:** The project name at the top is your training project. The **Project endpoint** on **Home**
belongs on the `Full project endpoint:` line; it is not the browser's `ai.azure.com` address.

If the project is missing, check that you signed in to the intended tenant, then ask the owner to confirm the project name
and your **Foundry User** role. Do not create another resource. See [Troubleshooting](../reference/troubleshooting.md) for tenant and role errors.

**A done:** your intended project is open and `session-notes.txt` contains your setup values.
Continue to [Lab 01 A](01-foundry.md#path-a); the B installation instructions are not an extra A exercise.

<a id="path-b"></a>

## B. Code: one folder, one environment

Use macOS/Linux or WSL on Windows ([install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install)), Bash/zsh, and Python 3.13. Steps 1–3 call `python3.13`; once step 3 activates `.venv`, later commands use its `python`. The Hosted runtime also uses 3.13.
For the offline rehearsal only, Python 3.14 also works; replace `python3.13` with `python3.14` in steps 1–2.
Every workshop command in this guide passes `--language en`; without it, the CLI uses the Korean bundle.
Do not install into global Python or change the system's default Azure subscription.

If an activated, configured terminal was supplied, keep **that repository and terminal** and complete steps **1, 2 and 5**.
Do not download another copy, reinstall SDKs or replace its `.env`. Otherwise complete **1–5** in order.

<a id="reading-code-blocks"></a>

### What to copy, and where

| Block or notation | Your action |
|---|---|
| `bash` | Run in the repository terminal, not the browser console or Python's `>>>` prompt. Copy commands without the surrounding backticks |
| `dotenv` / `.env` values | Edit the named file in your editor; do not run or shell-`source` it |
| Python, JSON or YAML example | Read the surrounding instruction: it identifies explanatory code, expected output or the file to edit. It is not another terminal command |
| `<your-...>` | Replace the entire placeholder, including angle brackets, with your verified value |
| `read -r NAME` | Enter the requested value, without extra quote characters, then press Enter. Keep `$NAME` and `${NAME:?...}` unchanged in later commands |
| `outputs/...` / `.build/...` | A file path relative to the source repository root, not a command. Open it in the editor's file list; enable hidden folders if `.build` is not visible |

Run one block and inspect its result before the next. Lines joined by `\` form one command;
`&&` runs the next command only after success. A returned shell prompt means **finished**, not **passed**.
`${NAME:?...}` stops before a command if a required value is missing. Restore it from your notes, not a recording.
New terminals do not inherit values entered with `read`.

<a id="offline-rehearsal"></a>

<a id="source-folder"></a>

### 1. Open the folder

**Waiting for Azure approval?** Complete only steps 1–2 below. Neither requires Azure credentials or external Python packages.

**Already have a prepared source folder?** Use it; skip the download. Keep its `.env`, `.venv` and `outputs/`,
including any existing `outputs/azure-objects.json` ownership record.
For later Azure steps, this must be a copy prepared for **this route, language and setup card**, not merely a folder that worked in an older edition.
If its project/model differs, preserve that copy and have the owner supply the current values for a fresh copy;
do not repoint a Search-owning copy or treat the older model's successful preflight as readiness for this guide.

<a id="editor-and-folder"></a>

**Need an editor?** **VS Code** means **Visual Studio Code**, the file editor used below.
Keep a supplied editor or existing installation; otherwise follow [the official installation steps for your operating system](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/overview#_install-vs-code).
These file and terminal steps need no AI extension, Copilot subscription or editor sign-in.

**No source folder yet?** Open [this repository](https://github.com/junwoojeong100/microsoft-foundry-labs-v1.2)
with a GitHub account that has access, then **Code → Download ZIP** and extract it.
This is the **source repository ZIP**, not the small learner-materials ZIP.

In VS Code, select **File → Open Folder...** and choose the extracted source folder,
not the ZIP file or its parent Downloads folder. **Check:** the Explorer file list shows
`README.md`, `pyproject.toml` and `scripts/` directly under the opened folder.
If they are inside another folder, open that inner folder instead before starting the terminal below.

<a id="terminal-check"></a>

**Check the terminal before copying commands:**

- **macOS/Linux:** in VS Code, open **Terminal → New Terminal** and use Bash or zsh.
- **Windows:** use a WSL-connected VS Code window, not PowerShell or Command Prompt.
  With the [WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) prepared, press **F1 → WSL: Reopen Folder in WSL**.
  Check that the bottom-left indicator says **WSL: …**, then open **Terminal → New Terminal** there.
  Python 3.13 and, later, Azure CLI must be available **inside WSL**; a Windows installation alone does not provide them there.

If the prompt is `>>>`, you are inside Python: enter `exit()` first to return to the terminal.
Do not paste the workshop's Bash blocks into that Python prompt.

<details>
<summary>Optional alternative: Git download without the large screenshots and videos</summary>

Use this **instead of** the ZIP download, not after it. Git must already be installed.
Run this block in the **parent directory where you want the new source folder**, not inside an existing workshop copy.
The `microsoft-foundry-labs-v1.2` destination must not already exist; keep older copies and their evidence.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/junwoojeong100/microsoft-foundry-labs-v1.2.git microsoft-foundry-labs-v1.2 &&
cd microsoft-foundry-labs-v1.2 &&
git sparse-checkout set --no-cone '/*' '!docs/assets/' '!videos/'
```

**Check:** the terminal is now inside the new `microsoft-foundry-labs-v1.2` folder, with `scripts/` and `pyproject.toml`.
`docs/assets/` and `videos/` are intentionally absent; view screenshots on GitHub.
If cloning or changing folders fails, `&&` prevents the next command from changing another checkout.
Stop at that error; do not run the remaining lines separately. Continue with the folder check below.

</details>

In either case, the terminal's directory must contain `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, and `scripts/`.
If Python is missing, install [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first; do not continue past a `command not found` error.

```bash
pwd
python3.13 --version
python3.13 scripts/workshop.py --language en doctor
```

Expected fields include `documents: 6`, `dev_cases: 6`, `holdout_cases: 4`,
`azure_tested: false`, and `result: PASS`. **PASS does not mean Azure sign-in succeeded.**



![September 24 English recording: Open the source folder and run the offline doctor](../assets/g6sol-20260924-en/screenshots/E00-001-folder-2.webp)

**What to check:** Read all three counts and `azure_tested: false`. This checks files
and the local runtime, not a successful Azure call.

**Offline only?** Skip B's personal-notes preparation below and go directly to
[step 2: fixed examples](#offline-fixtures). No setup-card values, `.env`, SDK installation or Azure sign-in are needed.
B learners and people preparing A's Lab 05 terminal complete the notes preparation before step 2.

<a id="prepare-notes"></a>

#### Prepare B's personal notes once

The source ZIP already contains the blank worksheets; **B does not need another learner ZIP or the [Lab 03 A browser agent](03-prompt-agent.md#path-a)**.
B creates its own managed agent in [Lab 03 B](03-prompt-agent.md#path-b); that is a required core step, not an optional browser exercise.
Create a separate, Git-ignored working directory. The `&&` chain stops if it exists, so it cannot overwrite earlier notes:

```bash
mkdir -p outputs &&
mkdir outputs/learner-notes-en &&
cp data/learner/en/{session-notes.txt,workflow-review.txt,operations-checklist.txt,SOURCE.json} outputs/learner-notes-en/
```

If this folder already belongs to your current pass, keep it and resume without running the copy block.
For a new pass, choose a new notes-directory name and use it consistently. Never fill files under `data/learner/`.
Open the copied `session-notes.txt` and fill its **Lab 00 - setup card** with the owner's values (path: `English / B`).
After that, use only **B - code evidence and handoff** and **Pause / resume**; skip the entire **A - browser notes only** section,
including its Playground and source-check fields. The B section has its own lab-by-lab review lines.
If an older personal copy lacks a named line, append that line there; do not replace your filled notes with the new blank template.
**Self-study on B with earlier setup attempts?** Keep your `setup-attempts.txt` beside these personal notes and copy every recorded
resource group, its state and remaining cost/cleanup owner into item 4 of `operations-checklist.txt`; not just the group now in `.env`.
**Preparing only A's Lab 05 terminal?** Run the block anyway, because Lab 02 B saves `model.json` and `answer-local.json` there,
but leave this copy blank: your notes stay in the learner ZIP's `session-notes.txt`.

The B commands in Labs 02/03/04/05/06 include **`--output`**, which saves the complete JSON to this notes directory
and still prints it. **No terminal-to-editor copying is needed.** Open the saved file at each **Save** checkpoint.
The parent directory must exist; an existing file or an out-of-scope path stops before the request.
If you chose another notes directory, change every `--output` path consistently. Keep an earlier result instead of repeating a paid call.
Without `--output`, these commands still only print JSON. On a request failure, record the actual error and failed step;
no successful-response file is created. [Save behavior and recovery](../reference/commands.md#saving-json).
`collect`/`evaluate` already write `outputs/<label>/`; keep those generated folders in place and do not edit their responses.

<a id="offline-fixtures"></a>

### 2. Learn the output format without Azure

**The first fixture deliberately fails the business checks. No model is called.**
Run one block, check its result, then continue to the next block.

```bash
python3.13 scripts/workshop.py --language en demo --label rehearsal-v1 --prompt v1
```

**Expected:** `total: 6`, `passed: 0`, `errors: 0`, `business_gate_passed: false`.
v1 removes citations from fixed answers so you can see the checker reject them.
This **0/6 is intentional**, not an installation or Azure error. Keep the result unchanged.

```bash
python3.13 scripts/workshop.py --language en demo --label rehearsal-v2 --prompt v2
```

**Expected:** `total: 6`, `passed: 6`, `errors: 0`, `business_gate_passed: true`.
v2 uses the original fixed answers with their citations. Open `manifest.json`, `responses.jsonl`
and `business-evaluation.json` in each of `outputs/rehearsal-v1/` and `outputs/rehearsal-v2/`.
Both runs say `mode: offline-fixture`; neither contains a model response.

```bash
python3.13 scripts/workshop.py --language en compare --baseline rehearsal-v1 --candidate rehearsal-v2
```

**Expected:** `outputs/rehearsal-v2/comparison-vs-rehearsal-v1.json` keeps the two results
and the `OFFLINE FIXTURES ONLY` warning. Their difference is **not a measured prompt improvement**.
The three commands above return exit code `0` when successful, even though the first fixture's business gate is false.
A message starting with **FAIL:** or a nonzero exit code is a command error: stop and use [recovery](../reference/troubleshooting.md#resume-safely).
To rerun intentionally, use two fresh labels, such as `rehearsal2-v1` and `rehearsal2-v2`, in the matching demo and comparison commands.


![September 24 English recording: Compare fixtures without claiming model quality](../assets/g6sol-20260924-en/screenshots/E00-005-fixture-compare-2.webp)

**What to check:** Read `OFFLINE FIXTURE` and the final warning. No model was called
with two prompts to obtain this difference.

**Offline-only stop:** keep the two fixture folders and record cloud labs **not run**.
The following SDK/sign-in steps are for the code route, not required to finish this rehearsal.

### 3. Install a virtual environment and SDKs

```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv &&
source .venv/bin/activate &&
python -m pip install -e ".[cloud,agents]"
```

Keep the `&&` separators: installation runs only after the virtual environment is created and activated successfully.
If either step fails, fix that first error; do not run the `pip install` line separately against global Python.

Versions are pinned in `pyproject.toml`. Do not add the entire `agent-framework`
metapackage. Add `.[hosted]` only for [selected Hosted/Toolbox SDK work](extensions/developer-toolkit.md#hosted-sdk), not for B's package-only Lab 08. Never bypass download errors by
disabling certificate validation or using an untrusted mirror.

In each new terminal, return to this same repository root and run `source .venv/bin/activate`; do not recreate the venv or reinstall the SDKs.
Do not paste Bash into a browser developer console or Python's `>>>` prompt.


![September 24 English recording: Create the virtual environment and install the pinned SDKs](../assets/g6sol-20260924-en/screenshots/E00-006-install-2.webp)

**What to check:** The output ends with `Successfully installed …`; a following `[notice]` about a newer pip is not an error, and you do not upgrade pip.
A line starting with `ERROR` means stop and resolve the installation first. Installation is not Azure connectivity.

### 4. Sign in and configure `.env`

Use the [official Azure CLI installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
**Already signed in with your own training account? Keep that sign-in.** Prepare `.env` below, then use step 5 to check
the configured subscription and tenant. Opening a new terminal or preparing `.env` does not require another login.
If you have not signed in, use the [sign-in block](#azure-sign-in) below before step 5.

```bash
if [ -e .env ] || [ -L .env ]; then
  printf '%s\n' '.env exists; edit it without replacing it.'
else
  cp .env.example .env
fi
```

**What to check:** `.env` now exists, or the block printed `.env exists`, so you inspect the existing file.
This file-preparation block neither signs in nor changes the Azure CLI default subscription.

Open `.env` in VS Code and fill **section 1** with the setup-card values. Keep its local defaults;
add **section 2's Search endpoint only for Lab 06**. Leave the advanced fields alone unless that module is selected.
If `.env` already exists, inspect it instead of overwriting it with the copy command.

| Required setting | Source |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | IDs of the designated subscription/directory |
| `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `AZURE_AI_ACCOUNT_NAME` | Prepared training resources |
| `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | **Full** project endpoint |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | `gpt-6-sol`; owner verifies model version `2026-09-22` |
| `WORKSHOP_PREFIX` | Must start with `mfv2-`; lowercase letters/digits and single hyphens, no trailing hyphen, at most 32 characters total |
| `WORKSHOP_AUTH_MODE` | `cli` locally; `managed-identity` only in an actual Azure runtime |

Scripts read `.env` without replacing existing process variables. Old endpoint
variables in a terminal can therefore take precedence. If they conflict with the setup card, open a fresh terminal at this same
repository root and run `source .venv/bin/activate` before step 5. If preflight still reports different values,
stop and resolve the inherited settings with the owner; do not change the intended project to match them.
Do not store API keys, passwords, or access tokens in this file.
No Microsoft 365 account or real customer document is needed.

<a id="azure-sign-in"></a>

<details>
<summary>First sign-in or expired authentication only — not a routine setup or 403 recovery step</summary>

Learners sign in themselves. **`az login --tenant` can still select/change the Azure CLI default subscription**
([official behavior, checked 2026-09-25](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively#subscription-selector)).
If an existing shared profile's default must remain unchanged, stop and ask the owner for an isolated, learner-signed-in
environment rather than running this block there. Do not use `az account set`, `az logout` or `az account clear` as a shortcut.

Only in your own profile or the owner-prepared isolated environment:

```bash
printf 'Azure tenant ID from your setup card: '
read -r AZURE_TENANT_ID
az login --tenant "${AZURE_TENANT_ID:?Enter the tenant ID from your setup card}"
```

Verify that the sign-in lists your own account in the intended tenant and subscription, then return to step 5.
The workshop uses `.env`'s `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` without changing the default; login alone does not establish model permissions.
For a 403, have the owner check the actual caller and required role instead of repeatedly signing in.

</details>

### 5. Run the read-only Azure preflight

```bash
python scripts/workshop.py --language en doctor --cloud
```

Verify the setup card's subscription, tenant and full project endpoint. For this core route, require
**deployment name `gpt-6-sol`, underlying model `gpt-6-sol`, version `2026-09-22`, and state `Succeeded` together**.
`doctor --cloud` reports the configured deployment; `Succeeded` on an older model is not a pass for this preset.
This command creates no resources and does not change the default subscription.
On failure, read the Azure CLI diagnostic under `Command stderr:` when present; `CalledProcessError` alone does not identify a missing role.
If the deployment lookup reports an authorization error, ask the owner for **Reader** on the training Foundry account;
the preflight reads the deployment through Azure Resource Manager. For a different error, preserve it and check the setup card's
subscription/resource names and network access before retrying; do not change the default subscription or model.
Preflight does not prove data-plane permissions or Structured Outputs support;
[Lab 02](02-models.md) tests an actual request.


![September 24 English recording: Read-only Azure preflight: gpt-6-sol 2026-09-22 Succeeded](../assets/g6sol-20260924-en/screenshots/E00-008-preflight-2.webp)

**What to check:** Read `deployment.name`, `deployment.model.name`, `deployment.model.version`,
`deployment.state: Succeeded`, `inference_tested: false`, and `note`.
Only an actual response verifies inference. If preparing A's terminal, complete Lab 02 B's actual response checks,
then use [its A return choices](02-models.md#a-terminal-ready): start A from Lab 00, or resume Lab 05 only if you paused there.

**B done:** the local checks pass and the intended deployment passes read-only preflight.
Continue to [Lab 02 B](02-models.md#path-b) for actual inference. Keep all later terminal commands at this repository root with `.venv` active.

<details>
<summary>More September 24 gpt-6-sol captures (reference; not steps to repeat)</summary>

These captures come from the September 24, 2026 English recording with `gpt-6-sol` / `2026-09-22`. Use your own resource names, versions and results.

![September 24 English recording: Prepare B's personal notes once](../assets/g6sol-20260924-en/screenshots/E00-002-notes-2.webp)

**What to check:** B prepares the personal notes folder once; later commands save their JSON there. Nothing here calls Azure.

![September 24 English recording: Offline fixture v1: not a model response](../assets/g6sol-20260924-en/screenshots/E00-003-fixture-v1-2.webp)

**What to check:** `OFFLINE FIXTURE` v1 is a fixed sample file, not a model response. Its failed checks are part of the exercise.

![September 24 English recording: Offline fixture v2 and its lineage](../assets/g6sol-20260924-en/screenshots/E00-004-fixture-v2-2.webp)

**What to check:** v2 changes only the fixture. Read its lineage fields; do not treat the result as model quality.

![September 24 English recording: Copy .env.example and fill it from the setup card](../assets/g6sol-20260924-en/screenshots/E00-007-env-2.webp)

**What to check:** The recording's `RUN_TOOLS/configure_env.py` helper wrote the setup-card values into `.env`; edit yours by hand. Compare the project endpoint, `gpt-6-sol`, the judge deployment and your prefix with your own card.

## Completion

- A: Open the correct project and explain the deployment name and chosen path.
- B: Complete offline checks and SDK installation, and understand cloud preflight results.
- Waiting for approval: record **Azure labs not run** if you completed only the offline exercise.
