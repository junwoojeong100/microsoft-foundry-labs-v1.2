# Capability coverage and evidence boundaries

**English** | [한국어](ko/coverage.md)

**Latest — September 27, 2026:** [approved blocker resolution and real outcomes](reference/approved-resume-20260927.md) ·
[updated scoped status matrix](assets/approved-resume-20260927/guide-checks.json). Integration execution is not an all-pass quality claim.

**September 26 live audit:** [deployment, results and limitations](reference/live-audit-20260926.md) ·
[all 62 language-specific guide/workbook statuses](assets/live-guide-audit-20260926/guide-checks.json).
This newer record adds actual Hosted deployments and independent core runs; it does not turn the historical table below into all-feature verification.

**Current state:** the September 24, 2026 `gpt-6-sol` recording covers the main A/B steps of Labs 00–09 and 11 and the
optional Foundry evaluation steps (portal and trace evaluation, business rubric with **Compare runs**, MAF tool-call scoring).
Separate September 23 `gpt-6-sol` checks cover the conversation evaluation module, the existing-traces and recurring
evaluations, Agent Optimizer, cloud red teaming and the approved Hosted release. The other extension results below date from
September 16, 2026 (earlier `gpt-5.6-luna` preset) and are not evidence for `gpt-6-sol`, except where a September 24 or 25 row says otherwise.
On September 25 both core routes ran end to end as written in both languages ([results](live-run.md#end-to-end-20260925)), a short supplement recorded Lab 03 B and the Lab 09 B trace search in both languages, and English runs covered conversation evaluation, memory, a routine and the Toolbox up to discovery.
This page is a coverage record, not a claim that every Foundry feature has been executed.
The later [September 25 headless follow-up](live-run.md#headless-guide-audit-20260925) added new bilingual model/inline-agent responses,
six-row manual assessments and A/B portal trace correlation. It reused existing agents, created no new version and recorded no new video.
File Search upload was disabled for the selected model. The measured browser response times are not a learner pilot.
The production order is English guide → English recording → English refinement → Korean guide →
independent Korean recording → Korean refinement.

**Final closeout:** after the guide corrections and offline gates, [32 bounded CLI checks and two local package commands](live-run.md#final-guide-closeout-20260925)
completed in English and Korean, with fresh portal trace correlation. The [item-by-item status](assets/final-guide-closeout-20260925/module-checks.csv)
covers all 12 labs and 17 extension guides without claiming every optional feature was rerun. The separate MCP 403 and one workflow citation finding remain recorded.

## Read the status honestly

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Existing lab | Executable guidance already exists; use the linked validation record for the exact historical scope |
| In preparation | Additional guide/code is being authored; no new live or media completion claim |
| Live verified | A dated, versioned response and required source/error/usage evidence exist for this edition |
| Recorded | Actual action/video/source-frame records exist; a screenshot alone is not execution |
| Design only | Architecture or prerequisite review; no service connection is claimed |
| Not run / blocked | Required approval, access, feature availability or data is absent |

GA/Preview is a **product property**, not one of these completion states.
An installed prerelease SDK does not make the entire service Preview; a GA service does not make all SDKs or tool modes GA.

## Current course map

| Capability | Path | Current workshop coverage | Latest dated evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Models, Prompt Agents, synthetic source evidence | A/B | Existing Labs 00–03 | 2026-09-25 headless: existing saved instructions matched the current learner files; two model and four inline-agent smoke replies per language. Creation was not repeated |
| Managed prompt agent as core route | B | Lab 03 B now treats the managed Prompt Agent as core practitioner work | 2026-09-24 live-verified in English and Korean with the refreshed pins (create, exact-version invoke, trace); 2026-09-25 screenshots and short clips in both languages |
| Functions, local MCP, MAF orchestration | B | Existing Labs 04–05 | 2026-09-25 CLI guide audit in both languages; the initial English Group Chat credential timeout and its explicit retry remain recorded |
| Browser option for A Lab 05 | A | Optional owner-prepared Hosted workflow agent can be tested in the portal Playground | 2026-09-24: the workflow agent answered one local Responses request; remote deployment and Playground use not run |
| Search/hybrid/GA IQ and separate MI chat preset | B/C | Existing Lab 06 and keyless preset | 2026-09-25 CLI guide audit: local, Search and GA IQ retrieval in both languages. Hybrid RAG and the `gpt-5.6-luna` IQ Chat preset not re-run (configuration screen checked 2026-09-17) |
| Business/native evaluation and frozen acceptance | A/B | Existing Lab 07, plus optional portal evaluation, no-evidence diagnostic, code-based business evaluator and **Compare runs** | 2026-09-24 `gpt-6-sol` recording and 2026-09-23 verification in both languages ([results](live-run.md)); custom evaluators and TaskAdherence are Preview |
| Tool-call evaluation of the MAF agent | B | Optional `maf-evaluate` in Lab 04 | 2026-09-24 `gpt-6-sol` recording and 2026-09-23 verification in both languages; experimental MAF evaluation API |
| Trace check as core evidence | A/B | Lab 09 A/B records actual trace evidence or an explicit unverified reason | 2026-09-25 headless: A's new responses and B's original audit responses matched portal trace IDs, agent versions and input/output tokens in both languages; B was not invoked again for trace lookup |
| Standalone SDK recipes | B/C | Minimal offline recipe files for model, prompt-agent, MAF, IQ and Hosted patterns | 2026-09-24 offline stub tests and live runs of recipes 02–06 and 08 (English), after two fixes |
| [Code-along SDK practice](code-along.md) and [source-bound quality checks](reference/quality.md) | Optional learning / maintenance | Personal recipe copies, deliberate break/repair checks, one-command verification and all-revision translation hashes | 2026-09-26 local/stub-only work; no new Azure run, deployment, model-quality score or beginner pilot |
| SDK pin refresh | B/C | Refreshed dependency set and provider constraint documented | 2026-09-24 offline tests plus a live run of the core B route in both languages and the optional evaluations |
| [Hosted workflow/matrix/calibration/regression/traces](reference/evaluation-workbook.md) | C | Existing workbook | 2026-09-15 `gpt-5.6-luna` only (Korean four-model matrix); not re-run with `gpt-6-sol` |
| [Managed Toolbox lifecycle](labs/extensions/toolbox.md) | B | Executable owned/versioned path | 2026-09-25 `gpt-6-sol` (English): create and MCP discovery verified; the direct query was denied by Search because the project identity has only Search Index Data Reader. Earlier: 2026-09-16 `gpt-5.6-luna` direct query, MAF, local/remote Hosted and downloaded evidence verified |
| [Tool Search, Skills and private skill catalog](labs/extensions/tool-search-skills.md) | C | Executable Tool Search/Skill path | 2026-09-25: blocked by the Toolbox's Search access. Earlier: 2026-09-16 `gpt-5.6-luna` English discovery, pinning, exact Skill readback and actual load verified; catalog infrastructure not provisioned |
| [Full-conversation evaluation and reusable datasets](labs/extensions/conversation-evaluation.md) | C | Executable dev-only multi-turn path | 2026-09-23 `gpt-6-sol`: re-verified in both languages; both native levels ran. 2026-09-25 English re-run with the refreshed pins: turn 6/6 and 6/6, conversation 2/2 and 2/2 |
| [Agent Optimizer](labs/extensions/agent-optimizer.md) | C | One bounded Prompt Agent wizard | 2026-09-23 `gpt-6-sol`: re-run in both languages with a temporary `gpt-5.5` optimizer model; baseline only, and Groundedness compared each answer with itself, so nothing was promoted |
| [Durable human approval, restart recovery and steering](labs/extensions/approval-recovery.md) | C | Real local SDK demonstration | 2026-09-16: English restart/checkpoint proof with simulated decisions; not actual human authorization |
| [A2A 1.0](labs/extensions/a2a.md) | C | Explicit card/configuration and delegation | 2026-09-24 `gpt-6-sol`: English re-run with typed SDK requests, one delegated call verified (earlier: 2026-09-16 `gpt-5.6-luna`); wire packets not captured |
| [Memory](labs/extensions/memory.md) and [Routines](labs/extensions/routines.md) | C | Owned lifecycle and bounded timer | 2026-09-25 `gpt-6-sol` (English): memory lifecycle verified; one routine dispatch finished and was traced, answer retrieval unavailable. Earlier: 2026-09-16 `gpt-5.6-luna` |
| [Applied guardrails and controlled red teaming](labs/extensions/agent-safety.md) | C | Dedicated policy/target | 2026-09-16 `gpt-5.6-luna`: English attachment and two unblocked cases. 2026-09-23 `gpt-6-sol`: cloud red-team scans (Preview) ran, but the displayed ASR contradicted every row's reasoning, so no red-team result is claimed |
| [Continuous evaluation and deployment quality gates](labs/extensions/release-operations.md) | C | Manual guarded workflow and OIDC setup | 2026-09-23 `gpt-6-sol`: both OIDC releases, the existing-traces evaluations and one hourly recurring schedule per language (both then paused) verified ([results](live-run.md#previously-not-run-items--september-23-2026)); production approval remains separate |
| [Agent Insights](labs/extensions/agent-insights.md) | C | Preview portal review of recurring trace patterns and human decision flow | 2026-09-24: one on-demand SDK scan (English, 22 traces, 4 insights); portal path not run |
| [Model retirement/migration and Router tradeoffs](labs/extensions/model-operations.md) | C | Fixed-model comparison and Router observation | 2026-09-16 `gpt-5.6-luna`: temporary supported model and frozen version recorded; no Router migration claim |
| Cross-provider model comparison guidance | C | Model-operations and evaluation workbook explain adding one non-OpenAI Foundry Model under the same gates | Not run: the training project has no non-OpenAI deployment, and creating one needs owner approval. 2026-09-25 read-only check: `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` and `Mistral-Large-3` were offered with unused quota |
| [OpenAPI/Code Interpreter](labs/extensions/additional-tools.md), [Toolkit](labs/extensions/developer-toolkit.md), [governance/networking](labs/extensions/governance-networking.md) | B/C | Executable tools and explicit owner boundaries | 2026-09-16 `gpt-5.6-luna`: English API/file results, tooling and scoped role checks recorded; private network not tested |
| Actual company/Microsoft 365 access | Specialist | Excluded | Remains excluded |
| [Fine-tuning, voice/multimodal, browser/computer business actions](labs/extensions/specialist-scope.md) | Specialist | Design/scope only | Separate specialist curriculum, not an implied implementation |

## Evidence that already exists

The [September 24 `gpt-6-sol` execution](live-run.md), its [recordings](video-summary.md) and the
[validation scope](reference/validation.md) keep their own dates, code versions and results.
The September 24 recording is not relabeled as an execution of the extension modules.
The September 16 extension results and videos (earlier `gpt-5.6-luna` preset) were removed from the working tree;
their September 16 outcomes in the table above remain historical notes, not evidence for `gpt-6-sol`; rows dated September 23–25 are `gpt-6-sol` evidence for what they name.

New evidence must identify the language, source commit/package, actual model and agent version,
question/dataset/corpus/evaluator hashes, all responses and failures, and resource cleanup state.
Record requests and actual source activity, not a recreated success screen.
Authentication, passwords, tokens and MFA interactions are excluded from recordings.

## Straightforwardness acceptance

Every runnable module must have one recommended first pass, exact input files/values, complete commands,
an observable completion criterion, a stop/recovery path, and an explicit next link.
Optional alternatives follow the first success rather than competing with it.
Costs, roles and feature access appear **before** the first side-effecting command.

Do not mark a module complete because documentation links work or a fixture passes.
Read-only checks, real model calls, local-only demonstrations, Preview service execution and recorded actions are reported separately.
