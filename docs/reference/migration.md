# From the 2025 integrated labs to v1.2

**English** | [한국어](../ko/reference/migration.md)

**The concepts continue; execution contracts and learning paths were rebuilt.**
The original integrated workshop's last checked commit is dated December 14, 2025.

| Original module | v1.2 location | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 01. Environment | 00–01 | Separate browser/Python paths; no learner subscription Owner requirement |
| 02. Models/Router | 02 + 07 | Pin deployment names; distinguish fixed-model comparisons and routing |
| 03. Agents/tools | 03–04 | Managed Prompt Agent vs. local MAF; synthetic read-only tools |
| 04. Foundry IQ | 06 + 10 | GA intents vs. richer Preview; reference numbers vs. document IDs |
| 05. Portal workflow | 05 + 08 | MAF code instead of portal authoring; human-review/Hosted boundaries |
| 06. Evaluation | 07 | Dev/holdout, errors in denominator, frozen candidate, evaluator lineage |
| 07. Control Plane | 09 | Operational gates for versions, roles, traces, quota, costs, cleanup |

## How the smaller workshops were integrated

| Source | Learning structure retained | Integration changes |
|---|---|---|
| foundry-maf-workshop | Portal, model SDK, agent, tool, workflow, hosted | Shared CLI/environment and synthetic-policy scenario |
| agent-framework-labs | Single/sequential/concurrent/Group Chat/MCP/RAG | Same inputs, permission boundaries, explicit termination |
| microsoft-iq-on-foundry | Sources/bases, Toolbox, IQ distinctions | GA retrieval over bundled synthetic data; optional [IQ routing design](../labs/10-iq-extensions.md), not a company-data connection |
| foundry-evaluation | Enterprise learning loop, failures, dev/holdout, review | No mandatory four-model set; small shared data/provider choices |

## What was not copied unchanged

- Portal workflow node creation/connection/publishing; learn MAF builders in Lab 05.
- Subscription-specific verified model IDs, regions, and quota as universal defaults.
- Incompatible `.env` vocabularies or Python/SDK combinations.
- Customer data, personal environments, resource IDs, tokens, or filmed environment identifiers.
- Another repository's successful runs or scores as evidence for this edition.
- 2025 notebook cells mixed with current SDK 2.x.
- Claims that portal, local MAF, Hosted, and offline fixtures are one execution path.

Before adapting classic threads/runs/Assistants or `azure-ai-inference` examples,
check the [official migration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/how-to/navigate-from-classic).
Current transition/retirement guidance does not guarantee old examples still work.

## Retirement dates that affect old tutorials

Checked 2026-09-24. Use the current
[classic-to-new agent migration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/migrate)
before reviving an older sample.

| Old tutorial surface | Retirement date | What to do instead | Source |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Azure OpenAI Assistants API | 2026-08-26, already retired | Move to current Foundry agents and SDK 2.x patterns | [Assistants retirement note](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry-classic/openai/how-to/code-interpreter) |
| Foundry Agent Service classic agents using threads/runs/messages | 2027-03-31 | Migrate classic agents to the new Foundry agent service | [Classic agents deprecation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry-classic/agents/concepts/threads-runs-messages) |
| Foundry portal Workflows visual Preview | 2026-12-01 | Build new workflow logic with Microsoft Agent Framework | [Workflows retirement](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/workflow) |

## Repository name — September 27, 2026

The repository and checkout directory are named **`microsoft-foundry-v1.2-labs`**.
This is a workshop naming change, **not an SDK/API downgrade**. Projects SDK **2.x**,
prompt and rubric versions, and the date-based Python package version are unchanged.
New clones use the updated [Lab 00 commands](../labs/00-start.md#source-folder).
From an existing checkout, update its remote:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/junwoojeong100/microsoft-foundry-v1.2-labs.git
```

When renaming a local copy, preserve `.env`, `.azure/` and `outputs/`. Repair linked Git worktrees
with `git worktree repair`, and recreate any virtual environment whose paths still name the old directory.
Existing `mfv2-` Azure resource names and ownership records are not renamed.

Historical result JSON, screenshots, recordings and their integrity checks keep the names, paths and hashes
captured at execution time. Updated documentation links still identify the same original run IDs;
the rename is not new Azure execution or media evidence.
Before a separately approved CI release, recheck the actual OIDC subject using the
[release guide](../labs/extensions/release-operations.md). Renaming does not change Azure credentials or roles.

The core needs no additional repository clones or old notebooks. Return to your current lab,
or choose [A or B](../paths.md) if starting here; source links are background and attribution, not another setup sequence.
English is now the default entry point, with matching [Korean guides](../../README.ko.md).
