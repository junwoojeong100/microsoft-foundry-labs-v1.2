# Sources and integration lineage

**English** | [한국어](../ko/reference/sources.md)

**We integrated the source modules' learning structures, not their claimed execution results.**
Source check date: September 15, 2026. The commits below remain fixed even if upstream main changes.
New official-reference rows marked checked 2026-09-24 reflect this review refresh, not new workshop execution.
See [consolidation and archive gates](consolidation.md) for self-contained v1.2 replacement paths and optional-feature limits.

The separate [September 26 public-workshop comparison](quality.md#public-reference-sample) fixes seven additional
GitHub references to immutable commits. It compares educational patterns, not borrowed code, execution results or a global rank.

Package versions were compared with official PyPI release metadata. An `Unreleased`
section was not treated as an installable release. Older official `ChatAgent`/middleware examples can differ
from the installed SDK; the SDK contract checks compare the installed `Agent`, `ChatContext`, `Workflow.as_agent`
and host routes. A check date does not guarantee support in every subscription or region. [Validation](validation.md)
distinguishes illustrative URLs/IDs/scores from actual execution evidence.
